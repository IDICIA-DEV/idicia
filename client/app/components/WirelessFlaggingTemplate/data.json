  "section1":"TCPA is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and it prohibits using auto-dialers, and pre-recorded, and text messages to Cell Phones without the express written consent of the person you’re trying to be reached. These fines are steep and hard to get away from. ",
  "section2":"We have a service that takes these potential issues into consideration and protects you from TCPA violations. In this case, one of the main pieces of data needed is to know whether the phone number is a cell phone or not. Another piece of the puzzle is how old the data being verified is…..a day is an eternity when it comes to TCPA violations. The 3rd piece is, has the number been ported recently? This data changes constantly and our cell phone identification service solves these problems for you and keeps you in compliance with the TCPA.",
  "section3":"If you need help managing your consent, check out Telified-CR. It’s built to help with exactly that!"
