Because data transformation is one of our core competencies, we donâ€™t require you to code to our data formats. Instead, we will implement the data translations we need for our systems to interact with yours. This makes your transition from your current hosting provider to IDICIA simple and straightforward. Our experienced team will guide you through the process step by step. Storing with IDICIA will enhance and simplify your entire hosted business, reducing staffing and maintenance requirements and opening up new and broadened avenues to revenue."
